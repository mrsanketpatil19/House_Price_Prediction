# House_Price_Prediction
Developed a Linear Regression model for predicting property prices using a dataset with features like Sale Type and House Condition. 
Conducted comprehensive data cleaning, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies through imputation, outlier detection, and 
feature engineering. Employed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand variable distributions, identify patterns, and establish 
feature correlations.

‚óè	Implemented machine learning models (Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression, Elastic Net), fine-tuned hyperparameters through cross-validation, and assessed performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R-squared. Selected Linear Regression for its optimal balance of accuracy and interpretability, achieving an accuracy of 92%.
